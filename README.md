## Get to know me ðŸ‘‹


As a business analytics professional with a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics, Iâ€™m passionate about transforming data into strategies that drive smarter business decisions and growth. Data today has the power to transform businessesâ€”from enhancing customer experience to optimizing operationsâ€”and I bridge raw data with actionable insights using  **Python, R, SQL,  Tableau, and Grafana dashboards**.

At Honeywell International, I enhanced platforms for IoT data handling, boosting data capture and transmission efficiency while designing cost-effective storage solutions. My hands-on projects include real-time anomaly detection systems, market basket analysis, and health risk assessments, focusing on proactive decisions, reliability, and profitability. Additionally, my work in IoT data solutions empowers businesses with data-backed strategies for impactful growth.

With a toolkit that includes **Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Oracle, OpenShift, MySQL, Grafana, and MongoDB**, as well as development tools like **Visual Studio Code, JIRA, and GitHub**, I ensure that my projects deliver robust, insightful solutions. Here on GitHub, youâ€™ll find repositories where data science and business analytics tackle real-world challenges. Letâ€™s connect and explore how data can drive meaningful change!
