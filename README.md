## Get to know me ðŸ‘‹


As a business analytics professional with a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics, Iâ€™m passionate about turning data into strategies that drive smarter business decisions and growth. Data today transforms businessesâ€”from customer experience to operational efficiencyâ€”and I bridge raw data with actionable insights, using tools like Python, R, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.

At Honeywell International , I enhanced platforms for IoT data handling, boosting data capture and transmission efficiency while designing cost-effective storage solutions. My hands-on projects include real-time anomaly detection systems, market basket analysis, and health risk assessments, focusing on proactive decisions, reliability, and profitability. Additionally, my work in IoT data solutions empowers businesses with actionable insights that drive smarter, data-backed strategies.

On GitHub, youâ€™ll find repositories where data science and business analytics meet to solve real-world challenges. Letâ€™s connect and explore how data can drive change and opportunity!
